Thanks for considering!

Before you contribute, please submit an issue to discuss the idea!

All changes must be covered by a test and must follow the Go, [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and [Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) style guides. I'm also mostly on the same page with Uber's [Go style guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide), so that can be used as an inspiration as well.
